Strategic-Information-Product-Fitbit

As a part of project to create a strategic Information product for a company, I have designed a comprehensive food recommendation system for Fitbit, a popular health and fitness technology company. Our strategic information product provides personalized suggestions for healthy food options based on the user's daily calorie limit and preferred food category, leveraging the dataset provided by the City of New York on nutritional information of food items sold in restaurants.

System
The developed system allows users to track their food intake and monitor their progress towards their dietary goals, with reminders and alerts to help them make healthy choices throughout the day. The visually appealing user interface is accessible via mobile app and web portal, continuously updated with the latest nutritional information, and customizable to adjust to users' changing preferences and goals.

I believe this product will be a valuable addition to Fitbit's suite of health and wellness products as it promotes a healthier lifestyle by supporting users in making informed decisions about their nutrition. It can also differentiate Fitbit from its competitors by offering a unique and personalized feature that enhances user loyalty and reduces the likelihood of users seeking alternative solutions for their nutrition needs.

Our food recommendation system is based on a comprehensive and reliable dataset provided by the City of New York, which ensures the accuracy and reliability of the information provided. It also uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to process the data and provide personalized recommendations to users, increasing the product's effectiveness and relevance.

Overall, I am proud to have designed a strategic information product that aligns with Fitbit's mission of promoting healthy lifestyles and wellness, while offering a unique value proposition to differentiate them from competitors. Our product provides users with actionable information that can help them make informed decisions about their diet and lifestyle choices, which is essential for maintaining good health and wellness.
